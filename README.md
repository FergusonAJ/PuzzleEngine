# PuzzleEngine
An evolutionary algorithm to generate puzzles with specific solving experiences.

A puzzle engine should be able to take a description of a solving experience and plug it into
a fitness function for an evolutionary algorithm.  An evolutionary algorithm should then be 
able to optimize that fitness function to produce a playable puzzle.

Initially, only Sudoku puzzles are implmented.
