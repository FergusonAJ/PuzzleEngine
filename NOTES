Next steps:
* Finish sudoku setup
  - Setup warning system for incorrect loads

* Build EA to evolve simple puzzles
* Add more sudoku rules (2-6)
* Indenitfy a full set of objectives and limited resources
* Build a lexicase selection
* Hook into Empirical for user interface


Fixes needed:
* Sudoku initialization with random values isn't working right.


Optimizations:
std::array<bool,?> could be changed to emp::BitSet
Instead of manual search through options for a cell, a lookup could return the next one.
