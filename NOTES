Next steps:
* Finish sudoku setup
  - Setup warning system for incorrect loads

* Add more sudoku rules (3-6)
* Hook into Empirical for user interface
* Idenitfy a full set of objectives and limited resources
* Build a lexicase selection


Fixes needed:
* Sudoku initialization with random values isn't working right.


Optimizations:
std::array<bool,?> could be changed to emp::BitSet
Instead of manual search through options for a cell, a lookup could return the next one.
